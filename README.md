## Features
- User authentication (likely includes login, registration, etc.).
- Modular route handling for organized API development.
- Environment-based configuration using `.env`.
- Pre-configured middleware for logging, error handling, and validation.
- Utilities for common tasks and reusable components.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend-project/Backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `Backend` directory.
   - Add required environment variables (refer to the `.env` file for guidance).

## Usage
Start the application using the following command:
```
npm start
```
For development mode with live reloading:
```
npm run dev
```

## Configuration
The project uses a `.env` file for sensitive configurations. Key variables may include:
- `PORT`: The port on which the server runs.
- `DB_URI`: The connection string for the database.
- `JWT_SECRET`: The secret key for JSON Web Tokens.

## API Endpoints
Here are some potential API routes based on the folder structure:

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/register` - Register a new user.
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate a user and provide a token.

### Posts (example)
- `GET /posts` - Fetch all posts.
- `POST /posts` - Create a new post.
- `PUT /posts/:id` - Update an existing post.
- `DELETE /posts/:id` - Delete a post.

**Note**: The exact routes should be confirmed by reviewing the `routes` folder.

## Dependencies
Key dependencies include:
- `express`: Web framework for Node.js.
- `mongoose`: ODM for MongoDB.
- `jsonwebtoken`: For handling authentication tokens.
- `dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
- `nodemon` (dev): Automatically restarts the server during development.
